A collection of auto-generated images for Radxa CM3 IO Board.

* Radxa debos image will have name started with the board name.

## Where can I download the image?

## Help! Something doesn't work!

This image assumes Radxa CM3 IO board. If you are using Raspberry Pi CM4 IO board, you will need to manually update `/boot/uEnv.txt` to use `rk3566-radxa-cm3-rpi-cm4-io.dtb` instead.
